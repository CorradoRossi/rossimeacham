It’s easy to get down on yourself when things aren’t going the way you’d hoped. Maybe you haven’t been able to keep up with a diet or exercise routine.  Maybe you haven’t had the success with your career or business that you expected. Or maybe you said or did something you regret and hurt someone you care about like a parent, partner, or friend.

Whatever it is, you can be sure of one thing. You don’t have to beat yourself up! Here are 5 reasons why you ought to cut yourself a little slack, take a deep breath, and continue working on improving yourself.

### 1. Stress is no good

When you come down on yourself, you’re not only keeping yourself low, you’re also taking valuable energy away from giving yourself a boost. Reinforcing patterns of negative behavior is way less productive than reinforcing patterns of positive behavior so try to give yourself some credit for what you are doing well. Remember that everything is going to be ok.

### 2. You’re doing fine

Remember, no matter what it is you’re doing in life, somebody is probably doing it better than you, and somebody is probably doing it worse than you. Your job isn’t to be the best in the whole world, it’s to work toward being the best YOU possible. Instead of judging yourself against everyone else, you should focus on your own path. Chances are you’re not as far away from where you want to be as you think you are.

### 3. Life is long

You don’t have to finish everything right this very instant! While it is important to remain productive and try to accomplish something every day (even if it’s just a little thing), it’s important to remember that life goes on. Often times our stresses and anxieties come from a sense that something has to happen right this very instant! That usually isn’t the case, and also causes you to stress out even more. Self fulfilling prophecy much!

### 4. Somebody loves you

Believe me, somebody out there loves you. Sometimes it feels like there is nobody in the world who cares for you but that just isn’t the case. Whether it’s your mom, or your significant other, or a son or daughter or friend, somebody somewhere cares. You need to remember that when you get down in the dumps. And also, you need to remember to love yourself. It’s very difficult to allow others to give you the love you deserve if you can’t give yourself some love.

### 5. You’re a good person

That’s right, I haven’t even met you and I’m telling you that. Why? Because it’s true! All you have to do to be a good person is genuinely want to be a good person. Even if you’ve done some stupid things in your life, you don’t have to define yourself by those things. Remember - life is constantly shifting and if you want it to, it will shift for the better. Keep your head up and put one foot in front of the other!
